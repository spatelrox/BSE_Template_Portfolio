# Smart Mirror
My project is the Smart Mirror, a mirror that displays different modules such as active weather, news, time, and date. On my mirror, I added a couple of modifications including a motion detector, google assistant, and a spotify integration module. It uses a raspberry pi to display all the modules on the mirror.

# Final Milestone
My third and final milestone was building and integrating my modifications. I added three modifications in total: motion detector, google assistant, and a spotify integration. I used one HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between the sensor and the wall it is looking at and detected if there was a change in that distance. That change in distance basically means there is something blocking the sensor (a person) and calculates the time between the trigger and the echo. The code then takes that time and translates it into a distance that we can read and interpret. If that distance changes, the mirror turns on, and when there is no longer anyone in front of the mirror, the mirror turns off. For the google assistant, I used the google assistant sdk online and created a google app on my raspberry pi that had google assistant api enabled. The spotify module was similar to the google assistant in that I had to create a developer app that had access to my account's api so that it knows what song is playing. The code then takes that data from the app and displays it on the mirror in the way I want it. An issue I ran into was with the ultrasonic sesnor module. One of the resistors on the breadboard was the wrong voltage and after replacing that the module worked. The other issue I ran into was when I integrated the google assistant onto my raspberry pi. One of the functions were not in the python library anymore and I had to replace it with the new function.

# Second Milestone
I had a vision before building this project to have an actual mirror that I can use on a day to day basis. So, for my second milestone I built a wood frame from scratch. I got the wood I needed and started sketching out the different cuts on the wood. I ran into issues when it came to getting the wood cut to the specific angles I needed. I had to visit many different wood stores to try to get the wood cut, however most of them could not cut the wood at anything other than a 90 degree angle. I decided to just get the cuts from my neighbor. most of the cuts were fine, but one of them was pretty rough, so it did not connect that well to the other wood. I had to fill in the gap between the wood with a sanded down clothes clip and use that as a thing that the wood glue can bond to. Another issue was time constraints. I still had to integrate my modifications and the wood glue had to set for a day. I made a makeshift stand for the frame using some of the extra wood I had. I also worked on installing the monitor and acrylic mirror. I carefully cut the acrylic to the dimensions of the monitor and placed that in the mirror. I then poaced the monitor in, which I secured using four wood wedges that are flush to the back of the monitor and secured to the frame using wood glue. In the end, I was really pleased with the result given this was one of the first times I independently worked with wood.

# First Milestone
  

For my first milestone, I worked on building the base display of the mirror. I had to research a lot on APIs and how to call them in my code. The module I had the most trouble with was the weather and weather forecast modules. I had to try a couple of different APIs, because I was looking for a free API. Once I created an account and got the API key, the other modules were pretty easy to understand and build.
