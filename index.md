# Smart Mirror
The Smart Mirror is a mirror that displays different modules such as active weather, news, time, and date. On my mirror, I added a couple of modifications including a motion detector, google assistant, and a spotify integration module.

# Final Milestone
My third and final milestone was building and integrating my modifications. I added three modifications in total: motion detector, google assistant, and a spotify integration.

# Second Milestone
I had a vision before building this project to have an actual mirror that I can use on a day to day basis. So, for my second milestone I built a wood frame from scratch. I got the wood I needed and started sketching out the different cuts on the wood. I ran into issues when it came to getting the wood cut to the specific angles I needed. I had to visit many different wood stores to try to get the wood cut, however most of them could not cut the wood at anything other than a 90 degree angle. I decided to just get the cuts from my neighbor. most of the cuts were fine, but one of them was pretty rough, so it did not connect that well to the other wood. I had to fill in the gap between the wood with a sanded down clothes clip and use that as a thing that the wood glue can bond to. Another issue was time constraints. I still had to integrate my modifications and the wood glue had to set for a day. I made a makeshift stand for the frame using some of the extra wood I had. In the end, I was really pleased with the result given this was one of the first times I independently worked with wood.

# First Milestone
  

For my first milestone, I worked on building the base display of the mirror. I had to research a lot on APIs and how to call them in my code. The module I had the most trouble with was the weather and weather forecast modules. I had to try a couple of different APIs, because I was looking for a free API. Once I created an account and got the API key, the other modules were pretty easy to understand and build.
